R:
top

R:
/proc/887

What process was run first? How can you tell?
R:
systemd.Porque ele tem o PID #1.


Complete the table specifying in what area of top output the following information is found:

What command is used to read the following binary logs?
/var/log/wtmp
/var/log/btmp
/run/log/journal/2a7d9730cd3142f4b15e20d6be631836/system.journal

R:
/var/log/wtmp - last
/var/log/btmp - lastb
/run/log/journal/2a7d9730cd3142f4b15e20d6be631836/system.journal - journalctl

In combination with grep, what commands would you use to find out the following
information about your Linux system?

When the system was last rebooted (wtmp)
R:
last

Which hard disks are installed (kern.log)
R:
less /var/log/kern.log

When the last login occurred (auth.log)
R:
less /var/log/auth.log

What two commands would you use to have the kernel ring buffer displayed?
R:
dmesg e journalctl -k (e também journalctl --dmesg).

Indicate where the following log messages belong:
Jul 10 13:37:39 debian dbus[303]: [system] Successfully activated service 'org.freedesktop.nm_dispatcher'

/var/log/kern.log

Have journalctl query information about the following units?

Unit	Command
ssh
networking
rsyslog
cron

R:
Unit	        Command
ssh             journalctl -u ssh.service
networking      journalctl -u networking.service
rsyslog         journalctl -u rsyslog.service
cron            journalctl -u cron.service

Explorational Exercises

Reconsider the top output from the guided exercises and answer the following questions:

What two steps would you follow to kill the apache web server?
R:
Primeiro, pressionar k; depois fornecer um valor kill.

In the summary area, how could you display the information about physical memory
and swap using progress bars?
R:
Pressionando m uma ou duas vezes.

Now, sort the processes by memory usage:
R:
M

Now that you have memory information displayed in progress bars and processes
sorted by memory usage, save these configurations so that you get them as
default next time you use top:
R:
W

What file stores top’s configuration settings?
Where does it live?
How can you check for its existence?
R:
O arquivo é ~/.config/procps/toprc e ele fica no diretório inicial do usuário (~).
Como se trata de um arquivo oculto (reside em um diretório cujo nome começa com um ponto),
podemos verificar sua existência com ls -a (listar todos os arquivos).
Esse arquivo pode ser gerado pressionando kbd:[Shift+W] enquanto estamos em top.

Learn about the command exec in Bash.
Try to demonstrate its functionality by starting a Bash session,
finding the Bash process with ps, then run exec /bin/sh and search
for the process with the same PID again.
R:
PID=`echo $$`
echo ${PID}
ps auxf | grep ${PID} | head -1
exec /bin/sh
PID=`echo $$`
echo ${PID}
ps auxf | grep ${PID} | head -1


Follow these steps to explore kernel events and udev’s dynamic management of devices:

Hotplug a USB drive into your computer.
Run dmesg and pay attention to the last lines.
What is the most recent line?
R:
Deve aparecer algo semelhante a [ 1967.700468] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk.

Bearing in mind the output from the previous command, run ls /dev/sd*
and make sure your USB drive appears in the listing.
What is the output?
R:
Dependendo do número de dispositivos conectados ao sistema,
deve aparecer algo semelhante a /dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2.
Em nosso caso, encontramos nosso drive USB (/dev/sdb) e suas duas partições (/dev/sdb1 e /dev/sdb2).

Now remove the USB drive and run dmesg again.
How does the most recent line read?
R:
Deve aparecer algo semelhante a [ 2458.881695] usb 1-9: USB disconnect, device number 6.

Run ls /dev/sd* again and make sure your device disappeared from the listing.
What is the output?
R:
Em nosso caso, /dev/sda /dev/sda1.
