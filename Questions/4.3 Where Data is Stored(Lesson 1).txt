50

R:

xx= Major Revision = 15
y = Minor Revision = 0
zzz=Patch number = 50

What command would you use to list all hard drives and partitions in /dev?

R:
ls /dev/sd*


Explorational Exercises

Device files for hard drives are represented based on the controllers
they use — we saw /dev/sd* for drives using SCSI
(Small Computer System Interface) and SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment), but
How were old IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) drives represented?
/dev/hd*

And modern NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) drives?
/dev/nvme*

Take a look at the file /proc/meminfo.
Compare the contents of this file to the output of the command
free and identify which key from /proc/meminfo correspond to the following
fields in the output of free:

free output	/proc/meminfo field
R:

total - MemTotal / SwapTotal
free - MemFree / SwapFree
shared - Shmem
buff/cache - Buffers, Cached and SReclaimable
available - MemAvailable
