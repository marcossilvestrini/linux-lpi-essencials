Guided Exercises

Use the following file structure to answer the following three questions:

/
├── etc/
│   ├── network/
│   │   └── interfaces/
│   ├── systemd/
│   │   ├── resolved.conf
│   │   ├── system/
│   │   ├── system.conf
│   │   ├── user/
│   │   └── user.conf
│   └── udev/
│       ├── rules.d
│       └── udev.conf
└── home/
    ├── lost+found/
    ├── user/
    │   └── Documents/
    └── michael/
        └── Music/

What command will navigate into the network directory regardless of your current location?
R:
cd /etc/network

What command can user enter to navigate into their Documents directory from /etc/udev?
Use the shortest possible path.
R:
cd ~/Documents

What command can user enter to navigate into michael 's Music directory? Use the shortest possible path.

When you run the command ls -lrS, what file will be at the beginning?
R:
The three folders are all 4.0K, which is the smallest file size.
ls will then sort the directories alphabetically by default. The correct answer is the file scary.jpg.

Please describe what you expect to see as the output for ls -ad */.
R:
This command will show all subdirectories, including hidden subdirectories.

Explorational Exercises

Run the ls -lh command in a directory that contains subdirectories.
Note the listed size of these directories. Do these file sizes seem correct to you?
Do they accurately represent the contents of all files inside that directory?
R:
No, they do not. Each directory has a listed file size of 4096 bytes.
This is because directories here are an abstraction: they don’t exist as a tree structure on the disk.
When you see a directory listed, you are seeing a link to a list of files.
The size of these links is 4096 bytes.

Here is a new command to try: du -h.
Run this command and describe the output that it gives you.
R:
The du command will generate a list of all files and directories,
and indicate the size of each. For example, du -s will display the file size of all files,
directories, and subdirectories for a certain location.

On many Linux systems, you can type in ll and get the same output as you would if you typed ls -l.
Please note however that ll is not a command. For example, man ll will give you the message
that no manual entry exists for it.
This is an example of an alias. Why might aliases be useful to a user?
R:
ll is an alias of ls -l.
In Bash, we can use aliases to simplify commonly-used commands.
ll is often defined for you in Linux, but you can create your own as well.
